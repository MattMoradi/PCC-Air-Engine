# PCC-Air-Engine

Tired of those darn old hand drawn designs for the PCC Air Engine project? Think you deserve better? Well here you are.

This repository contains all of the necessary files for the PCC Air Engine project from designs to gcode. All CAD modeling and CAM toolpathing was done using Autodesk Inventor HSM. Special thanks to Autodesk for providing this software free to students. All NC code has been optimized to run on the HAAS Mini-Mill 2005. This also contains the new standardized digital drawing file format and has replaced the previous hand drawn ones at Glencoe.
